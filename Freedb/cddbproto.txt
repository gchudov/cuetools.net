* Log statistics:
-----------------
Client command:
-> log [[-l lines] [start date [end date]] | [day [days]] | [get]]

    lines:
	The maximum number of lines to print for each data list in the
	log statistics.
    start date:
	The date after which statistics should be calculated. Date is
	of the format: hh[mm[ss[MM[DD[[CC]YY]]]]]

	E.g.:	201200053196 for 8:12 PM on May 31, 1996.
		20120005312096 for 8:12 PM on May 31, 2096.
		080530 for today at at 8:15 and 30 seconds.

	If the century ("CC") is omitted, a reasonable guess is made. If
	this argument is omitted, all messages are considered.
    end date:
	The date after which statistics should not be calculated. If
	omitted, the end date is assumed to be the current date.
    day:
	The string "day". This solitary argument will cause a log search
	of messages generated within the last day.
    days:
	A positive numerical argument which modifies the number of days'
        messages to searh. If this argument is left out, the default is 1.
    get:
	The string "get". This solitary argument will cause the server
	to send the contents of the log file.

Server response:
<- code Log summary follows
<- (log stats)
<- .
	or
<- code Log follows
<- (log stats)
<- .

    code:
	210	OK, log summary follows (until terminating marker)

<- code Last modified: date MOTD follows (until terminating marker)
<- (message text)
<- .

    code:
	210	Last modified: 05/31/96 06:31:14 MOTD follows (until terminating marker)
	401	No message of the day available
    date:
	The date the text of the message of the day was modified. The date
	appears in the following format:

		05/31/96 06:31:14

	This value may be used by client software as a message timestamp
	for purposes of determining if it has already been displayed. This
	format was chosen because it is more easily parsed than the standard
	ctime() format.


Server protocol level:
----------------------
Client command:

	501	Illegal protocol level.
	502	Protocol level already cur_level.
    cur_level:
	The current protocol level at which the server is running.
    supported_level:
	The maximum supported protocol level.

---------------------------
Client command:
-> quit

Server response:
<- code hostname message

    code and message:
	230 Closing connection.  Goodbye.
	530 error, closing connection.

    The possible data is as follows:
	current proto: <current_level>
	    An integer representing the server's current operating protocol
	    level.
	max proto:     <max_level>
	    The maximum supported protocol level.

	Database entries by category:
	    This field is followed by a list of catgories and the number
	    of entries in that category. Each entry is of the following
	    format:

		<white space>catgory: <num_db_entries>

	    The list of entries is terminated by the first line that does

		<white space>site: <num_db_entries>

	    The list of entries is terminated by the first line that does
	    not begin with white space.

	This list may grow as needed, so clients must expect possible

	the currently existing lines, although no existing fields will
	be removed or change position.
	

* Database update:
----------------
Client command:

	530	Server error, server timeout.


Reserved errors:
----------------

The following error codes are reserved, and will never be returned as a
response to a CDDB protocol command. They are intended to be used internally
by clients that have a need for generating pseudo-responses.

	600-699


CDDB Protocol Level 2:
----------------------

In all respects, protocol level 2 is the same as level 1, with the exceptions
listed below.

Arguments to commands may be surrounded by double quotes. All characters
within the quotes, including white space, are included in the argument. All
white space is replaced by the `_' (2Dh) character by the server. White space
is defined as ` ' (20h) and `^I' (control-I, or 09h).

Arguments containing quotes that should not be interpreted with the special
meaning described above should be escaped with a preceding backslash character,
or '\' (5Ch). If an actual backslash appears in an argument, it should be
escaped with a preceding backslash. In both cases, the preceding backslash
will be removed from the input before being interpreted.


CDDB Protocol Level 3:
----------------------

Protocol level 3 is the same as level 2, with the exception listed below.

The output of the "sites" command has changed to meet the folowing description:

    The data format is as follows:
	site protocol port address latitude longitude description

    The fields are as follows:
	site:
	    The Internet address of the remote site.
	protocol:
	    The transfer protocol used to access the site.
	port:
	    The port at which the server resides on that site.
	address:
	    Any additional addressing information needed to access the
	    server. For example, for HTTP protocol servers, this would be
	    the path to the CDDB server CGI script. This field will be
	    "-" if no additional addressing information is needed.
	latitude:
	    The latitude of the server site. The format is as follows:
		CDDD.MM
	    Where "C" is the compass direction (N, S), "DDD" is the
	    degrees, and "MM" is the minutes.
	longitude:
	    The longitude of the server site. Format is as above, except
	    the compass direction must be one of (E, W).
	description:
	    A short description of the geographical location of the site.

    Example:
	us.freedb.org cddbp 8880 - N037.21 W121.55 San Jose, CA USA
	us.freedb.org http 80 /~cddb/cddb.cgi N037.21 W121.55 San Jose, CA USA

Note that a site may appear once for each type of protocol it supports for
accessing the server.


CDDB Protocol Level 4:
----------------------

Protocol level 4 is the same as level 3, with the exception listed below.

The output of the "cddb query" command may result in multiple exact matches.
A new response code, 210, has been added to indicate that more than one
exact match has been found.

Server response:
----------------
<- code exact matches found
<- categ discid dtitle
<- categ discid dtitle
<- (more matches...)
<- .

    code:
        210 Found exact matches, list follows (until terminating marker)


CDDB Protocol Level 5:
----------------------

Protocol level 5 is the same as level 4, with the following exception:

The database entries returned when issuing the "cddb read" command now also 
contain DYEAR and DGENRE fields (between the DTITLE and the TTITLE's).
For more info on the new database entry fields take a look at the
database format specification


CDDB Protocol Level 6:
----------------------

Protocol level 6 is the same as level 5 except that the character set
is now UTF-8 instead of ISO-8859-1. Note that UTF-8 is an extension of
US-ASCII, just like ISO-8859-1 is an extension of US-ASCII, so there
is no difference between levels 5 and 6 as far as 7-bit ASCII data is
concerned.

Clients can convert data between UTF-8 and the user's preferred
character set using the iconv program and library function which are
provided by glibc-2.2 or by the portable library libiconv. (They are
also provided by the C library on some non-glibc systems, but often in
a buggy or incompatible form.) For example, to convert data to UTF-8
from the character set of the current locale in a shell script use
"iconv -t utf-8 < in > out".

For more information about Unicode and UTF-8 see:

    ftp://ftp.ilog.fr/pub/Users/haible/utf8/Unicode-HOWTO.html
    http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html


Addendum A: Proper use of CDDBP:
--------------------------------

There are a few guidelines that must be followed in order to make proper use
of CDDBP:

- When handshaking with the server via the "cddb hello" command, the client
  must specify its own name and version, not that of some other client (such
  as xmcd).

- Before performing a "cddb read", the client program MUST perform a
  "cddb query". Failure to do so may result in the client program receiving
  incorrect data from the server. Also, without performing a query, the
  client program will not benefit from close matches in the event of the
  lack of an exact match in the database.


Addendum B: CDDBP under HTTP:
-----------------------------

Accessing a server as a CGI script is done in much the same way as through
direct interaction. The command set is identical, though the method of
communication is through CDDBP commands encapsulated in the HTTP protocol.
The only limitation is that a single command may be executed per connection,
since HTTP is not truly interactive. For the server to be accessed in this
way, it must reside on the target host at a known URL which is accessible by
the host HTTP server. The client program must connect to the HTTP server on
the target host and issue an HTTP command with the appropriate CDDBP command
encapsulated within.

Commands may be submitted to servers in CGI mode using either the "GET" or
"POST" HTTP commands. Both methods are supported, and there is no real
difference between how both are to be used other than the syntactical
difference between the two methods. The "POST" method may provide the ability
to issue longer commands, though, depending on the architecture of the system
on which the server resides.

The server command must be sent as part of the "Request-URL" in the case
of the "GET" method, and as the "Entity-Body" in the case of the "POST"
method. In both cases, the command must be of the following form:

cmd=server+command&hello=joe+my.host.com+clientname+version&proto=6

Where the text following the "cmd=" represents the CDDBP command to be
executed, the text following the "hello=" represents the arguments to
the "cddb hello" command that is implied by this operation, and the
text following the "proto=" represents the argument to the "proto" command
that is implied by this operation.

The "+" characters in the input represent spaces, and will be translated
by the server before performing the request. Special characters may be
represented by the sequence "%XX" where "XX" is a two-digit hex number
corresponding to the ASCII (ISO-8859-1) sequence of that character. The
"&" characters denote separations between the command, hello and proto
arguments. Newlines and carriage returns must not appear anywhere in the
string except at the end.

All CDDBP commands are supported under HTTP, except for "cddb hello",
"cddb write", "proto", "put", "validate" and "quit".

For example, should user "joe" on system "my.host.com" be running xmcd 2.1,
a read request for his currenly playing CD might look like this:

cmd=cddb+read+rock+12345678&hello=joe+my.host.com+xmcd+2.1&proto=3

The server will perform the implied "proto" and "cddb hello" commands,
and then perform the requested "cddb read" command.

Server response to the command is encapsulated in the HTTP server response,
and appears in the "Entity-Body" exactly as it would appear using the CDDBP
protocol. Note that the HTTP response "Entity-Header" is not guaranteed to
contain a "Content-Length" field, so clients should be prepared to accept
variable length input. This is no different from operation under CDDBP. The
header will always contain a Mime "Content-Type" field which describes the
body of data as "text/plain".

For more detailed information on HTTP and Mime, see RFC 1945 and RFC 1521.


Addendum C: CDDBP under SMTP:
-----------------------------

The use of e-mail mode (SMTP) commands is simple. A special subject line
lets the server know that the e-mail contains a command, and somewhere in the
body there should be a HTTP-style server command; the server will execute
only one such commands per e-mail.

The subject for e-mail commands should look like this:

Subject: cddb #command arbitrary_string

The "arbitrary_string" should be some randomly-chosen string. The server
will include this string in the subject of the response. The rest of the
subject should appear literally as it does here.

Somewhere in the body of the e-mail should be exactly one server command. For
example:

cmd=motd&hello=joe+my.host.com+xmcd_via_email+v1.0&proto=6

As you might have noticed, this command is exactly the same as a HTTP-mode
CDDBP command. The command response will be mailed to the sender. Upon
successful completion of an e-mail command request (even if the command
itself was not successful), the reply will contain a subject which looks
like this:

Subject cddb #response ok arbitrary_string

Should the server be unable to process the e-mail command for some reason, the
subject will look like this:

Subject cddb #response failed arbitrary_string

In both cases, the "arbitrary_string" is the same as the one specified in the
initial command e-mail.
