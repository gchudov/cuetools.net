Author:  Michael A. McCloskey
Company: Schematrix
Version: 20040714

Personal Comments:
I created this unrar wrapper class for personal use 
after running into a number of issues trying to use
another COM unrar product via COM interop.  I hope it 
proves as useful to you as it has to me and saves you
some time in building your own products.
